			<h1 class="section-title">A Network for Software Developers</h1>	
					<P> Tunaweza is a Network of Software Developers from all over Africa where they can communicate 
					can share ideas, learn new technologies, contribute articles and discuss technology trends. 
					 
					By targeting 3rd and 4th year students of all the universities in the target regions and 
					offering them free training and experience to enable them to get a job, Tunaweza expects to be 
					able to register over 80% of all the students who will eventually become prefessional software
					developers. 
					Today there are relatively few African software developers as the industry in most sub-Sahara  
					countries is still in its infancy.This is changing fast and in a few years  
					there will be a great number.
					We are confident that we can build a user base of 50,000+ users from ten different  
					countries within 24 months. As confirmation of this, Tunaweza went live in Kenya February 2014 and  
					by the end of April (8 weeks) we had 1,234 registered users.</P>

					<p>

					Our experience to date has shown that when we have established a relationship 
					between a user and our site that the relationship becomes resilient. In other words,  
					the users stay in touch especially if we keep the site interesting and fun to use. 
					As a body software developers are very influencial on technology buying decisions  
					and can also influence trends, as well as being able to predict the direction that  
					future technology will go. </p>
